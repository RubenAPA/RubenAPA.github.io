											<h2>MARKET ANALYSIS ABOUT TOMATO-BASED SAUCES</h2>

										<p>Domain: Market Research and Analysis.<br />
											Created by: Rubén Padilla Aguilar.<br />
											Posted on: 08-16-2023.<br />
											Tools used: R Studio, PowerPoint and Power BI.<br />							
											Concepts used: Data modeling, DAX, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), ANOVA, Probit Model, Clusters.<br />
										</p>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">
											<strong>Dataset Info:</strong><br />
											1. The dataset was collected personally by colleagues and myself through a sensory panel at various farmer's markets in the Greater Metropolitan Area (GAM) of Costa Rica.<br />
											2. The dataset consists of various qualitative variables. For this project, we used variables that provide general information about the respondents and their answers to open-ended questions in the survey.<br />
											3. Data from 101 individuals were collected, resulting in a total of 404 records.<br />
											4. Data collection took place at 5 different farmer's markets located in Heredia, San José, and Cartago.<br />
											5. Data was preprocessed using Excel and Power Query was used to make minor adjustments to the data and variables.<br />
											6. Due to privacy concerns, the organization's name and the brands of the sauces used in the study are not disclosed.<br />
											<br />
											<strong>Business problem:</strong><br />											
											The report is complementary to the technical note <a href="https://revistas.tec.ac.cr/index.php/eagronegocios/article/view/6551">"Acceptability and Purchase Intention of Tomato-Based Sauces in the GAM, Costa Rica"</a> published in the scientific journal <a href="https://revistas.tec.ac.cr/index.php/eagronegocios/index">e-agronegocios</a>.<br />
											An organization in the industrial sector sought to gather market information in the GAM of Costa Rica. The goal was to understand the acceptability and purchase intention of individuals regarding their product, in comparison with other prominent competitors. This understanding would aid in devising a market strategy to 
											the product within the region, as well as determining the tastes and preferences of potential customers. Consequently, the implementation of a sensory panel was decided upon, aiming to collect opinions from individuals within the target market about four different types of tomato-based sauces (Italian-style), including the one 
											produced by the company in question. After the data collection phase we worked in an statistical analysis using R to identify the profile of the posible consumers and more. At the same time, 
											there arose the need to understand the opinions provided by the individuals in the sample and determine if these comments could contribute to improving the current product of the company.<br />
											Based on the aforementioned premise, the idea emerged to present these qualitative analyses to the organization, using a tool that facilitates the dynamic visualization of information.<br />
											<br />											
											<strong>Report Objective:</strong><br />
											1. Analyze the data obtained from various individuals in the sample to acquire information related to the target market and enable timely managerial decision-making by the organization.<br />
											<br />
											<strong>Visualization Process Objectives:</strong><br />
											1. Implement PowerPoint in the visualization process to achieve a simple and easily understandable design.<br />
											2. Compare the comments obtained from the different sauces used.<br />
											3. Distinguish between positive and negative comments.<br />
											4. Facilitate data comprehension through visual objects, considering the target audience.<br />
											5. Identify trends that might be of greater interest to the company and its product.<br />
											<br />
											<strong>Main Results:</strong><br />
											General:<br />
											1. A significant portion of the individuals in the sample have a high level of education (completed and incomplete university education).<br />
											2. The opinions captured through the survey are relevant, as they were obtained from individuals who frequently purchase such products and influence household purchases.<br />
											3. The greatest competition in the studied market, influenced by factors like favoritism, price, and availability, are Naturas and Pastas Roma sauces.<br />
											4. The attributes that individuals consider most important when deciding on a product are: taste, presentation, and price.<br />
											5. Sauces with the highest purchase intention, in descending order, are sauces 4, 3, and 2.<br />
											6. Most commented attributes that positively influence product acceptance are: texture, taste, essence of flavor, and spices addition.<br />
											7. Some fairly clear preferences among the respondents include: Sauces that lean more towards a natural and less artificial taste, those with a strong taste and color, those containing spices, those with spiciness, and those with sweetness. Regarding other attributes, the responses are more variable, hence there is no specific trend.<br />
											<br />
											Specific to Sauce 3:<br />
											1. The most appreciated characteristics among those who indicated they would buy the sauce are: Strong taste, natural taste, and flavor of spices.<br />
											2. The characteristics most disliked by those who indicated they would not buy the sauce are: Artificial taste, very liquid texture, and flavor of spices.<br />
											3. While it's true that the aforementioned points contradict each other, this occurs due to individual preferences.<br />
											<br />
											<strong>Final Analysis Recommendations:</strong><br />
											1. Take into account that we are analyzing individual comments, hence the data is highly variable and susceptible to the past experiences and preferences of each individual.<br />
											2. Keep in mind that sauce 3 is the focus, while sauces 1, 2, and 4 are competitors for comparison..<br />
											3. Although the results are significant, increasing the sample size in the future could provide decisions with greater data support.<br />
											4. It would also be important to conduct a similar study focused on extrinsic attributes, as these are relevant aspects when a potential customer chooses a product. 
											This would allow for a comparison between the comments from both studies.<br />
											5. A possible approach for the company would be to diversify the product and focus on specific populations.<br />
											<br />
											<strong>Considerations:</strong><br />
											1. Take into account that this project was realized to a organization in Costa Rica, so the report is in Spanish.
